Codes from R-files for STAT340

Here I am attempting to recreate the codes for the R-files that were provided by Dr. Marius Hofert in STAT340 using Python.

The coding in python is my interpretation of translating the R-codes to generate similar results. Mistakes in the python code are entirely mine. The original R-files are not provided here as they belong to Prof. Hofert.

Please let me know if you see any mistakes or improvements.
